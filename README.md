# usefulJavaScript
I am compiling some of the things I have been working on to become a better JavaScript developer - this is hoping that someone might stumble upon this repo and find it helpful, and also for myself, to keep track of my notes and good sources. 

You might find some things missing here and there since I had the idea of making this repo rather late in the process of picking up JS again - but I will keep updating. 

Note that a lot of these notes need editing and filling in the blanks - feel free to message me if you have any ideas for improvements.

## JS Basics and Beyond

My favorite JavaScript book: https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS.

This book has taught me a lot on how to play towards the strenghts of JS. The author made me strong advocate for the case of learning JS specifically rather than relying on the fact that I can program in other languages. I can now say that I love programming in JS, and this book taught me how to use it right rather than just making this work brute force. 

[Here](https://javascript30.com/) is a free 30 day challenge for Vanilla JavaScript by Wes Bos: . I have yet to complete this one (I have started...).

## ES6

This is a great class to learn ES6 and really JS in general, since he compares old vs new features quite well: http://wesbos.com/es6-for-everyone/

## React

## Data Structures in JS

[My notes on Data Structures in JS](https://github.com/maike-hilda/usefulJavaScript/blob/master/dataStructures.md)

## Algorithms

## Code Editors

My favorite is VS Code (the integrated terminal (I use bash on windows) is just the best.
