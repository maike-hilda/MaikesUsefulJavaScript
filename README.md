# usefulJavaScript
I am compiling some of the things I have been working on to become a better JavaScript developer - this is hoping that someone might stumble upon this repo and find it helpful, and also for myself, to keep track of my notes and good sources. 

You might find some things missing here and there since I had the idea of making this repo rather late in the process of picking up JS again - but I will keep updating. Note that a lot of these notes need editing and filling in the blanks - feel free to message me if you have any ideas for improvements.

## ES6

## React

## Data Structures in JS
